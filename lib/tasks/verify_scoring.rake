    puts
    puts "2. Fix missing weekly_points update in Game A:"

    puts "   - Ensure weekly_points = weekly_points_game_a + weekly_points_game_b"
    puts
    puts "3. Add consistency checks:"
    puts "   - Verify weekly_points always equals the sum of Game A + Game B"
    puts "   - Consider making weekly_points a calculated field instead of stored"
    puts
    puts "4. Test thoroughly with different scenarios:"
    puts "   - Regular wins (Game A correct, Game B correct)"
    puts "   - Partial wins (Game A correct, Game B incorrect)"
    puts "   - Tie games"

          Every week there will be 13 games to pick, chosen by yours truly,  Commissario 
        </li>
        <li>
          To the far right are the chosen games for the week.  I choose the games based on the top 25 ranked Teams, everyone’s favorites, please let me know your faves so I can include them as often as possible, as well as Monday’s Las Vegas/ESPN point spreads.    
        </li>
        <li>
          On the far left in the game A column, click on the teams that you  think will win straight up.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the second column of GAME A, Rank the Teams 1-13.  This means the team you feel has the strongest chance of winning their game gets a 13 and the team you think has the least chance of winning their game, that you picked to win, gets a 1. Please call me with questions. It took yours truly a bit of time to figure this out, and Glenn Smiley the founder of Pick 13, our predecessor from Texas. was very patient with me!
        </li>
        <li>
          In the Third column is Game B.  Pick which team you think will win, based on the point spread, that I have included.
        </li>

          Press save!  You can also print out your games.

        You have until a short while before the first game starts to make and change your picks. Usually it is on Saturday morning, but sometimes it is THURSDAY evening.

        Once I studied  Very hard to make my picks.  I used The Sagarin rankings.  It was  one of my worst weeks ever-2nd lowest score out of over 600 people. mostly I use USA Todays' Wednesday edition, Thank you Gail, and go by my gut. Noah Kraff probably rarely picks against Texas, and I doubt Amanda Schaefer would not pick Notre Dame, it would be sacreligious!  We have a lot of Wolverine and Badger fans too, and my son-in law is a Very Loyal Wildcat fan.
